/*********************************************************************************
 * (Game: hangman) Write a hangman game that randomly generates a word and *
 * prompts the user to guess one letter at a time, as shown in the sample run. *
 * Each letter in the word is displayed as an asterisk. When the user makes a *
 * correct guess, the actual letter is then displayed. When the user finishes a
 * * word, display the number of misses and ask the user whether to continue to
 * * play with another word. Declare an array to store words, as follows:
 * 
 * String[] words = {"write", "that", ...};*
