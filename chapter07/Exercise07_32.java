* (Merge two sorted lists) Write the following method that merges two sorted     *
* lists into a new sorted list.                                                  *
*                                                                                *
* public static int[] merge(int[] list1, int[] list2)                            *
*                                                                                *
* Implement the method in a way that takes at most list1.length + list2.         *
* length comparisons. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two    *
* sorted lists and displays the merged list. Here is a sample run. Note that the *
* first number in the input indicates the number of the elements in the list.    *
* This numberis not part of the list.                                            *
