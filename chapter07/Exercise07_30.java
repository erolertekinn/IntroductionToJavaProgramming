* (Pattern recognition: consecutive four equal numbers) Write the following      *
* method that tests whether the array has four consecutive numbers with the same *
* value.                                                                         *

* Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers and   *
* displays if the series contains four consecutive numbers with the same value.  *
* Your program should first prompt the user to enter the input size—i.e., the    *
* number of values in the series.                                                *
