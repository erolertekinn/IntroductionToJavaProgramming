 * 7.25 (Algebra: solve quadratic equations) Write a method for solving a
 * quadratic equation using the following header:
 * 
 * public static int solveQuadratic(double[] eqn, double[] roots)
 * 
 * The coefficients of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are passed to the
 * array eqn and the real roots are stored in roots. The method returns the
 * number of real roots. See Programming Exercise 3.1 on how to solve a
 * quadratic equation. Write a program that prompts the user to enter alues for
 * a, b, and c and displays the number of real roots and all real roots.
